This project was built as a part of the CS50 Professional Web Programming Certificate.

Python - Django, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Heroku

This project helped me developed an understanding of Django Models, using a model for both emails and users. 
Additionally, I gained experience working with the Django admin interface to manage these models.

The main takeaways from this project were:
 - How to work with JSON data and interact with the SQL database.
 - How to dynamically create and hide <div> elements using Javascript

Deployed on Heroku and uses a MySQL Database to store user data and emails.
